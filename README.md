## Introduction

Structured Outputs is a feature that ensures the model will always generate responses that adhere to your supplied [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/overview/what-is-jsonschema), so you don't need to worry about the model omitting a required key, or hallucinating an invalid enum value.
